# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this package.

## Related Systems

This package was merged into the `ai-trading-agent` monorepo from the
standalone `RahulSunnyCS/algo-automation` repo via `git subtree` (history
preserved) on 2026-09-19. The merge is not yet a cutover:

- **`algo-automation` (standalone repo)** has no daily cron itself (the
  workflow that runs this daily is `.github/workflows/daily-broker-login.yml`
  in whichever repo is live) — check that repo directly for its current
  schedule state before assuming this package's disabled schedule is the
  only one.
- **This package** (`packages/broker-login`) is where new work should land,
  but its own daily workflow (`.github/workflows/daily-broker-login.yml` at
  this monorepo's root) has its `schedule:` trigger commented out pending a
  verified `workflow_dispatch` run — see `docs/algotest-execution.md` in
  this repo's root for the full cutover plan, checklist, and rollback.

Its sibling package in this monorepo is `packages/contract-notes` (merged
from the standalone `trade-analytics` repo the same way, same cutover
status) — see that package's own `CLAUDE.md`.

For the deep technical context (architecture, TOTP conventions, testing,
gotchas) see the monorepo root's `.claude/project/technical.md` — this file
stays a short orientation pointer rather than duplicating that.

## What this package does

A Playwright job that logs Angel One and Finvasia into AlgoTest each
morning via TOTP (`generateTotp`/`freshTotp` from `@trading/broker-identity`
— see that package for the shared RFC 6238 implementation). The broker OAuth
handshake happens on the broker's own domain, so it cannot be done over
plain HTTP; every DOM locator lives in `src/selectors.ts` so a redesign on
AlgoTest's or a broker's side is a single-file fix.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # or: bun install from the monorepo root

npm run login         # tsx src/main.ts — the real daily job (needs live credentials + the 08:15-15:40 IST window)
npm run test-login     # tsx scripts/test-login.ts — connectivity + selector health check, any time of day, no broker secrets needed
npm run check         # tsx scripts/check.ts — RFC 6238 vectors, error classification, redaction, live TOTP codes + Telegram preflight (refuses to run in CI)
npm run record        # tsx scripts/record.ts — interactive flow recorder for capturing new selectors
npm run typecheck
```

## Source layout

- `src/main.ts` — entry point: waits for the login window, runs each broker's `login()`, sends the Telegram report
- `src/brokers/{angelone,finvasia}.ts` — one file per broker, each exporting a `Broker` (see `src/brokers/types.ts`)
- `src/selectors.ts` — every Playwright locator in the package, single-file fix on redesign
- `src/algotest.ts` — the AlgoTest platform login + My Brokers tab helpers (distinct from the broker OAuth handshake)
- `src/config.ts` — env var loading/validation; `Config.finvasia`/`Config.angelone` (the `SHOONYA_*` env var names are intentionally NOT renamed to match — see the comment there)
- `src/totp.ts` — thin re-export of `@trading/broker-identity`
- `src/secrets.ts` — thin re-export of `@trading/notify`
- `src/diagnose.ts` — screenshot/HTML dump helpers used on failure
- `src/notify.ts` — `formatReport()`, the broker-specific Telegram report formatter (transport itself is `@trading/notify`)
